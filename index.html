      <p><b>The Saiyan Saga</b> Upon their arrival, the Saiyans Nappa and Vegeta immediately destroy the city they landed in. Vegeta, wanting to find the Dragon Balls, uses his scouter to determine the location of the strongest warrior on the planet, whom he presumes to be the one who killed Raditz. They head off towards Piccolo and Gohan. Piccolo and Gohan sense the incoming powers, as well as several smaller ones, who turn out to be Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu. The Saiyans arrive. When Krillin arrives, Nappa and Vegeta also reveal that they came to Earth to use the Dragon Balls for immortality. After defeating all the others, Goku finally arives and defeats Nappa quite easily. Vegeta kills Nappa for being weak then challenges Goku himself. Goku tells Vegeta that he wants to fight elsewhere so as to not destroy the bodies of his friends. They head off to a desert, while Gohan and Krillin fly back towards the Kame House. Vegeta implies
      that not many low-class warriors like Goku get to spar with the elite like Vegeta, but Goku replies that even a lower-class reject can surpass the elite if he tries hard enough. Goku and Vegeta begin to fight, and appear to be evenly matched. Vegeta tells Goku to release his hidden power, to which Goku complies. He engages the Kaio-ken, however Vegeta manages to defend against it. In the end, with the help of his son Gohan and his friends, Goku manages to defeat Vegeta and allows him to leave Earth in his pod.

      <p><b>The Namek Saga</b> After the epic battle with the Saiyans, Vegeta feels stronger than ever and his self-proclaimed rival, Cui, informs Vegeta that his former boss, Frieza, decided to go after the Dragon Balls on Namek. Furious about the consequences of Frieza being immortal, Vegeta rushes to Namek himself, now openly declaring himself an enemy of Frieza. Soon, Frieza, Vegeta and our heroes all arrive on Namek with the seven Dragon Balls on their minds. There is one Dragon Ball per Namek village, each protected by the village elder. Obtaining them proves all too easy for Frieza who, with the help of his top two henchmen, Dodoria and Zarbon, bags four balls. As they go from one Namekian village to another, Zarbon and Dodoria butcher the Namekians until they locate the Dragon Ball. Cui has also followed Vegeta to Namek and searches the planet for his rival. After Vegeta catches up to Zarbon and Dodoria, they battle and he loses. Zarbon takes him to a healing chamber to question him later, not knowing that it would make him stronger. Eventually Vegeta fights Zarbon and Dodoria again and beats them individually. Freiza hears about their defeat calls for the Genyu Squad to find Vegeta and the Dragon Balls. The Genyu Squad finds vegeta along with Krillin and Gohan and they're forced to team up to take them on. Vegeta kills Guldo and takes on Racoome next but the brute is too much for him. Goku shows up to finish off Racoome, Burter and Jeice. Vegeta eventually joins Goku and his friends to stop Freiza from getting the Dragon Balls and making his wish. Vegeta challenges Freiza and his power isn't enough to stop him. Freiza kills Vegeta but when Krillin, Dende and Gohan summon Shenron, they wish Vegeta back to life then wish everyone besides Goku and Freiza back to Earth.

      <p><b>The Android Saga</b> After everyone but Goku made it back to Earth, they sensed a familiar, yet dangerous power. Turns out it was Freiza on his way to Earth. They Z Fighters quickly scrambled and went to the location Freiza's ship was expected to land. After the ship lands, Freiza exits the ship with his father, King Cold and his army. A young fight steps in and challenges Freiza. As Freiza thinks he has the upperhand, the young fighter defets the army, then turns Super Saiyan to defeat Freiza and King Cold. After the battle, the fighter greets the Z Fighters and tells him where Goku's ship will land. Vegeta is already frustrated that Goku is a Super Saiyan, but learning that someone else has acheived a level of power that he still hasn't begins to enrage him. Goku's ship lands and the young fighter introduces himself as Trunks and that needed to challenge Goku. The two fly off away from the group and both turn Super Saiyan. The two warriors spar and when they're done, the young fighter reveals that he is Trunks, Vegeta's son from the future and that two androids are coming to destroy the world in 3 years. The day that androids are set arrive, Goku and his friends find the androids and Goku begins to fight them but then passes out from a heart disease. </p>
